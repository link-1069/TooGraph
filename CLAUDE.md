# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TooGraph is a visual node-based editor and runtime workspace for LangGraph-style agent workflows. Users compose workflows by creating nodes, connecting state/data edges and control-flow edges, configuring agent skills and runtime defaults, validating the graph, then running it against a FastAPI + LangGraph backend.

`node_system` is the only formal graph protocol in active use. `state_schema` is the single source of truth for graph data, while nodes declare what state they read and write.

The product model is graph-first: the whole graph is the Agent, and an individual `agent` node should be treated as one LLM-node turn, one structured output step, or one capability-input preparation step.

The current mainline is the Vue frontend plus the FastAPI backend. Treat current repository files as the implementation source of truth.

## Current Source Of Truth

When repository guidance overlaps, prefer the current files in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `README.md`
3. `docs/current_project_status.md`
4. The code itself

Keep this file aligned with those sources and with the actual codebase.

## Development Commands

### Standard Cross-Platform Start

The standard restart command for this repository is:

```bash
npm start
```

This resolves to:

```bash
node scripts/start.mjs
```

Use it as the default startup and restart flow on Windows, macOS, Linux, and WSL.

Windows PowerShell note:

```powershell
npm.cmd start
```

Use that form if execution policy blocks `npm.ps1`.

For Bash-oriented environments, the repository also keeps this wrapper:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

Both startup paths should:

- release occupied TooGraph ports before starting
- serve the UI and API from the single public port `3477` by default
- wait for readiness checks
- write server logs to `.toograph_server.log`

### Dependency Install

Install frontend dependencies from the repo root:

```bash
npm --prefix frontend install
```

Install backend dependencies with Python 3.11+:

```bash
python -m pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

If the system Python command is `python3`, use that instead. If Python is installed outside `PATH`, set `PYTHON` before running `npm start`.

### Makefile Commands

```bash
make frontend-install
make start
make frontend-build
make backend-install
make health
```

### Frontend npm Scripts

Run these from `frontend/`:

- `npm run build` - `vue-tsc --noEmit && vite build`
- `npm run preview` - Vite preview server on `127.0.0.1:3477`

### Health Check

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3477/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

## Repository Rules

- Commit messages must be written in Chinese.
- After runtime code changes, restart with the standard cross-platform flow above.
- If a task only changes documentation or other non-runtime files, use judgment on whether a restart is needed.
- For UI work, prefer existing project libraries before custom controls.
- The primary UI library is Element Plus with `@element-plus/icons-vue`.
- Keep `scripts/start.mjs` and `scripts/start.sh` behaviorally aligned.
- Do not introduce or revive an alternate graph protocol; `node_system` is the only active graph contract.

## Frontend Architecture

### App Shell And Routing

- Entry: `frontend/src/main.ts`
- Router: `frontend/src/router/index.ts`
- Shell: `frontend/src/layouts/AppShell.vue`
- Pages:
  - `/` -> `HomePage.vue`
  - `/editor`, `/editor/new`, `/editor/:graphId` -> `EditorPage.vue`
  - `/library` -> `GraphLibraryPage.vue`
  - `/buddy` -> `BuddyPage.vue`
  - `/presets` -> `PresetsPage.vue`
  - `/skills` -> `SkillsPage.vue`
  - `/models` -> `ModelProvidersPage.vue`
  - `/model-logs` -> `ModelLogsPage.vue`
  - `/runs` -> `RunsPage.vue`
  - `/runs/:runId` -> `RunDetailPage.vue`
  - `/settings` -> `SettingsPage.vue`

### Frontend Modules

- API helpers: `frontend/src/api/`
- Stores: `frontend/src/stores/`
- Editor code: `frontend/src/editor/`
  - `anchors/`
  - `canvas/`
  - `nodes/`
  - `workspace/`
- Global styles and Element Plus theme overrides: `frontend/src/styles/`
- Shared helpers: `frontend/src/lib/`
- Types: `frontend/src/types/`

### Editor Reality

The editor surface is custom Vue code. Element Plus is used for standard application controls, while the canvas, node cards, ports, routed edges, minimap, workspace shells, and runtime overlays are TooGraph-specific.

Current node families:

- `input`
- `agent`
- `condition`
- `output`
- `subgraph`

Current editor capabilities reflected in code:

- canvas-driven node creation
- node creation from connection handles
- dropped-file creation for input nodes
- state/data edges and control-flow edges
- condition branch routing with loop limits
- subgraph nodes created from graph templates
- subgraph instance editing in workspace tabs
- state editor and agent configuration popovers
- edge visibility modes
- minimap
- runtime node and edge feedback
- run activity panel
- output previews
- Python export/import UI wiring
- human review panel plumbing in the editor workspace
- Buddy floating-window graph run flow and pause-card integration

### Frontend Tests

The frontend includes many colocated `*.test.ts` and `*.structure.test.ts` files across `src/api/`, `src/editor/`, `src/layouts/`, `src/lib/`, `src/pages/`, and `src/styles/`. Preserve this style when extending targeted coverage.

## Backend Architecture

### App Entry And Routers

- Entry: `backend/app/main.py`
- Routers in `backend/app/api/`:
- `routes_graphs.py`
- `routes_knowledge.py`
- `routes_local_input_sources.py`
- `routes_memories.py`
- `routes_model_logs.py`
- `routes_presets.py`
- `routes_runs.py`
- `routes_settings.py`
- `routes_skill_artifacts.py`
- `routes_skills.py`
- `routes_templates.py`
- `routes_buddy.py`

### Backend Modules

- Graph validation: `backend/app/core/compiler/validator.py`
- LangGraph runtime and codegen: `backend/app/core/langgraph/`
- Runtime state helpers: `backend/app/core/runtime/`
- Pydantic schemas: `backend/app/core/schemas/`
- JSON and SQLite storage: `backend/app/core/storage/`
- Knowledge loading and search: `backend/app/knowledge/`
- Memory loading: `backend/app/memory/`
- Skill definitions and registry: `backend/app/skills/`
- Model-provider and local LLM helpers: `backend/app/tools/`
- Template registry and loader: `backend/app/templates/`
- Buddy Home and command storage: `backend/app/buddy/`

### Persistence Layout

Under `backend/data/`:

- `graphs/` - saved graphs as JSON
- `kb/` - knowledge base manifests and downloaded source archives
- `presets/` - saved presets as JSON
- `runs/` - run records as JSON
- `checkpoints/` - LangGraph checkpoint data
- `settings/` - saved app settings
- `skills/` - imported skill state
- `memories/` - memory records loaded by `/api/memories`
- `toograph.db` - SQLite database for knowledge base metadata and FTS search

Some directories are created on demand. Indexed knowledge base content lives in SQLite plus FTS tables, while `backend/data/kb/` stores import manifests and download artifacts used by the knowledge importer.

Project-level reusable assets are stored outside `backend/data/`:

- `graph_template/official/` and `graph_template/user/` - graph templates
- `node_preset/official/` and `node_preset/user/` - node presets
- `skill/official/` and `skill/user/` - Skill packages
- `knowledge/TooGraph-official/` - official TooGraph knowledge-source Markdown

### Runtime Model And Tool Configuration

Settings and runtime defaults are built from the backend model catalog and tool registry.

For local or private model setup, start the OpenAI-compatible gateway you want to use, then configure it in TooGraph:

- TooGraph -> Model Providers -> Local / Custom OpenAI-compatible

Model execution reads saved Model Providers configuration and default model selections from the UI. Startup environment variables do not configure model providers.

## Graph Execution Pipeline

1. The frontend submits a `node_system` graph payload.
2. The backend validates it with the Pydantic schema and `validator.py`.
3. Save and run flows persist graph or run state through the storage layer.
4. The LangGraph runtime executes the graph in the background when supported.
5. Checkpoints, run state, node status, outputs, and artifacts are persisted during execution.
6. The frontend polls run detail and projects runtime state back onto the editor and run-detail views.

Important runtime constraints:

- LLM nodes are still represented by the internal `agent` kind; do not introduce a parallel graph protocol while migrating naming.
- One LLM node may use at most one explicit capability source: no capability, one selected Skill, or one incoming `capability` state.
- Static Skill use stores scalar `config.skillKey` and runtime-owned `skillBindings.outputMapping`.
- Dynamic capability execution writes exactly one `result_package` state.
- `subgraph` nodes run isolated child graph state and expose only their input/output boundaries to the parent graph.

Resume support exists for runs with available LangGraph checkpoints and valid graph snapshots. Standard human-review pauses use `awaiting_human` and `/api/runs/{run_id}/resume`.

- `advanced_web_research_loop`
- `buddy_autonomous_loop`
- `toograph_skill_creation_workflow`
- `buddy_autonomous_review` - internal background Buddy autonomous review and Buddy Home writeback template, not a normal user-facing template entry

## Working Expectations For Agents

- Read the existing code path before editing. The project already has clear module boundaries in both frontend and backend.
- Follow the existing Vue + Pinia + Element Plus patterns on the frontend.
- Follow the existing FastAPI + Pydantic + storage-layer separation on the backend.
- Keep edits scoped to the current request. Do not revive stale planning work or broad refactors unless the task clearly needs them.
- When updating docs, keep `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/current_project_status.md` mutually consistent.
