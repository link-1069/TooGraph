# Task Plan: Repository Cleanup Execution Rounds 21-30

## Goal
Run a ten-round conservative cleanup batch focused on `EditorCanvas.vue` pure projection and interaction-model helpers, then close the baseline interaction regressions in one larger pass while preserving graph editing behavior, runtime visuals, drag/connect workflows, deletion behavior, and dev startup health.

## Progress Accuracy Note
- The earlier `99.x%` values are no longer treated as the true total optimization progress. They reflected the active frontend cleanup batch getting close to its own tail, not the whole architecture roadmap.
- The honest full-roadmap progress must include P0 cleanup, P1 `NodeCard.vue`, P2 `EditorCanvas.vue`, P3 `EditorWorkspaceShell.vue`, and P4 backend runtime/provider cleanup.
- Current conservative estimate after Phase 126: full roadmap is about 98.0% complete; frontend-focused roadmap is about 92-93% complete; P3 `EditorWorkspaceShell.vue` is about 96% complete; backend P4 is about 95% complete.

## Current Phase
Phase 127 in progress

## Autonomous Continuation Gate
- After every completed cleanup phase, re-read `docs/future/2026-04-28-architecture-refactor-roadmap.md`, `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, and `progress.md`, then recalculate the total roadmap progress and the active area progress.
- Record the recalculated total progress in the `Progress Estimate` table before ending the round.
- If total roadmap progress is below 100%, automatically open the next phase in this plan, mark it as the current phase, choose the next safest roadmap slice, and continue with the same safety loop: red/focused tests, implementation, focused verification, full verification when needed, dev restart for code changes, commit, and push.
- If total roadmap progress reaches 100%, switch the current phase to final completion, run the final verification suite, commit/push any remaining documentation updates, and stop the automatic cleanup loop.
- If a blocker makes automatic continuation unsafe, document the blocker, the current progress estimate, and the reason continuation is paused in both `task_plan.md` and `progress.md`.

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Make the next batch exactly ten cleanup rounds | The user explicitly asked to increase the next round count to ten. |
| Stay mostly inside `EditorCanvas.vue` | It remains a large mixed-responsibility component, and the selected helpers are pure enough to test without UI risk. |
| Avoid backend runtime refactors in this batch | Backend executor/provider files need broader behavior fixtures and are higher risk than the current canvas projection helpers. |
| Keep side effects local | DOM measurement, refs, timers, emits, lock guards, and viewport mutation stay in the component. |
| Automatically continue below 100% total progress | The user explicitly asked that each completed round re-judge total optimization progress and open the next round when the roadmap is not yet complete. |

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Structure test still expected the old inline forced-edge-id block | Focused post-implementation run | Updated the assertion to verify the extracted `buildForceVisibleProjectedEdgeIds` boundary and flow confirm id input. |
| Virtual any output drags no longer auto-snapped to new agent inputs after cleanup | Baseline comparison against `8017081` | Restored virtual output pending-source preservation in `buildPendingAgentInputSourceByNodeId`, added regression coverage, and extracted follow-up interaction helpers into `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.ts`. |
| `vue-tsc` flagged unused NodeCard destructures and mock DOM type gaps after `usePortReorder` extraction | Phase 19 TypeScript verification | Stopped destructuring global pointer handlers/pointer state in `NodeCard.vue`, made test source elements satisfy `EventTarget`, and narrowed query results inside `usePortReorder.ts`. |
| Agent prompt textarea lost parent scoped surface styling after moving into `AgentNodeBody.vue` | Phase 25 visual screenshot | Moved the required surface/textarea styles into `AgentNodeBody.vue` and added structure coverage for the local scoped style. |
| Root `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` printed TypeScript help instead of checking the project | Phase 26 TypeScript verification | Re-ran the unused-symbol check through `frontend/node_modules/.bin/vue-tsc` from the `frontend` directory, which completed with exit 0 and no diagnostics. |
| `ConditionNodeBody.vue` and `NodeCardTopActions.vue` were missing during the Phase 28 red test | First focused structure run before implementation | Added both child components and reran focused structure/model tests successfully. |
| Unescaped backticks in `rg` shell commands triggered `/bin/bash: line 1: NodeCard.vue: command not found` | Phase 28 source inspection and plan sanity-check commands | Re-ran inspection with safer quoting; no code was changed by the failed shell interpolation. |
| Fresh screenshot tooling probe found no `chromium`, `playwright`, or `puppeteer` available from the current shell | Final visual-check refresh after dev restart | Kept the Phase 28 screenshots already captured earlier in this round and used fresh HTTP health checks for final dev verification. |
| `vue-tsc` flagged an unused `nodeDrag` destructure after the Phase 31 composable extraction | Phase 31 TypeScript verification | Stopped destructuring `nodeDrag` in `EditorCanvas.vue` and updated the structure test to assert that the drag ref stays owned by the composable. |
| Vue `emit` overloads rejected a union event name from `CanvasConnectionCompletionAction` | Phase 33 TypeScript verification | Kept action projection pure, but emitted through an explicit `switch` in `EditorCanvas.vue` so each overload stays type-safe. |
| Unescaped backticks in an `rg` shell command triggered `/bin/bash: line 1: emit: command not found` | Phase 33 planning verification | Re-ran the search with single-quoted shell text; no files were changed by the failed read-only command. |
| Unescaped backticks in an `rg` shell command triggered `/bin/bash: line 1: EditorCanvas.vue: command not found` | Phase 44 progress/status inspection | The command was read-only, produced enough usable output, and no files were changed by the failed shell interpolation. |
| Structure tests still expected local `EditorCanvas.vue` auto-snap helper names after the resolver extraction | Phase 34 focused green run | Updated the assertions to lock the new `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.ts` resolver boundary instead of the previous local helper layout. |
| First Phase 38 browser screenshot captured only the app background | Phase 38 browser smoke | Re-ran headless Chrome with `--virtual-time-budget=7000`; the second screenshot rendered the workspace normally. |
| Playwright package was unavailable for the Phase 38 screenshot helper | Phase 38 browser smoke | Used the installed `google-chrome` headless screenshot command instead. |
| First browser screenshot after Phase 35 dev restart captured only the app background | Phase 35 browser smoke | Re-ran headless Chrome with a virtual-time budget; the second screenshot rendered the workspace normally. |
| Structure test still expected a direct `if (isGraphEditingLocked())` guard after lock handling had moved into action models | Phase 54 focused green run | Updated the assertion to verify delegated locked action routing for double-click/drop and connection-completion execution instead of relying on a broad inline guard substring. |
| Unescaped backticks in an `rg` shell command triggered `/bin/bash: -c: line 1: unexpected EOF while looking for matching ``` | Phase 55 documentation inspection | Re-ran the read-only search with single-quoted shell text; no files were changed by the failed command. |
| Unescaped backticks in an `rg` shell command triggered `/bin/bash: line 1: EditorWorkspaceShell.vue: command not found` | Phase 79 documentation inspection | The command was read-only and no files were changed; re-read the needed document sections with safer quoting before updating the plan. |
| Unescaped backticks in an `rg` shell command triggered `/bin/bash: line 1: EditorWorkspaceShell: command not found` | Phase 90 documentation inspection | The command was read-only and no files were changed; re-read the needed document sections with safer quoting before updating the plan. |
