# Task Plan: Repository Cleanup Execution Rounds 21-30

## Goal
Run a ten-round conservative cleanup batch focused on `EditorCanvas.vue` pure projection and interaction-model helpers, then close the baseline interaction regressions in one larger pass while preserving graph editing behavior, runtime visuals, drag/connect workflows, deletion behavior, and dev startup health.

## Current Phase
Phase 32 in progress

## Autonomous Continuation Gate
- After every completed cleanup phase, re-read `docs/future/2026-04-28-architecture-refactor-roadmap.md`, `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, and `progress.md`, then recalculate the total roadmap progress and the active area progress.
- Record the recalculated total progress in the `Progress Estimate` table before ending the round.
- If total roadmap progress is below 100%, automatically open the next phase in this plan, mark it as the current phase, choose the next safest roadmap slice, and continue with the same safety loop: red/focused tests, implementation, focused verification, full verification when needed, dev restart for code changes, commit, and push.
- If total roadmap progress reaches 100%, switch the current phase to final completion, run the final verification suite, commit/push any remaining documentation updates, and stop the automatic cleanup loop.
- If a blocker makes automatic continuation unsafe, document the blocker, the current progress estimate, and the reason continuation is paused in both `task_plan.md` and `progress.md`.

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Make the next batch exactly ten cleanup rounds | The user explicitly asked to increase the next round count to ten. |
| Stay mostly inside `EditorCanvas.vue` | It remains a large mixed-responsibility component, and the selected helpers are pure enough to test without UI risk. |
| Avoid backend runtime refactors in this batch | Backend executor/provider files need broader behavior fixtures and are higher risk than the current canvas projection helpers. |
| Keep side effects local | DOM measurement, refs, timers, emits, lock guards, and viewport mutation stay in the component. |
| Automatically continue below 100% total progress | The user explicitly asked that each completed round re-judge total optimization progress and open the next round when the roadmap is not yet complete. |

## Notes

- Phase 20 starts the roadmap `StatePortList.vue` step with a conservative slice for agent real input/output state port rows only; create-port popovers remain in `NodeCard.vue`. `NodeCard.vue` drops to 4,544 lines before final verification.
- Phase 21 continues the roadmap `StatePortList.vue` step by moving agent `+ input`/`+ output` create rows and create-popover wiring into the child component while leaving draft mutation, validation, locked guards, and graph emits in `NodeCard.vue`. `NodeCard.vue` drops to 4,472 lines before final verification.
- Phase 23 starts the roadmap node-body component step with `AgentSkillPicker.vue`; `NodeCard.vue` drops to 4,231 lines before final verification while keeping skill config mutation behavior in the parent.
- Phase 24 continues the roadmap node-body component step with `AgentRuntimeControls.vue`; `NodeCard.vue` drops to 3,954 lines before final verification while keeping model derivation, refresh-model emit, lock guards, and agent config mutation behavior in the parent.
- Phase 25 wraps the agent node body presentation in `AgentNodeBody.vue`; `NodeCard.vue` drops to 3,895 lines before final verification while keeping state derivation, draft mutation, lock guards, skill patch creation, and graph emits in the parent.
- Phase 26 moves the input node body presentation into `InputNodeBody.vue`; `NodeCard.vue` drops to 3,562 lines while keeping input value derivation, uploaded asset parsing, knowledge-base options, lock guards, file/drop handlers, and state/config emits in the parent.
- Phase 27 moves the output node body presentation into `OutputNodeBody.vue`; `NodeCard.vue` drops to 3,373 lines while keeping output preview derivation, output config handlers, lock guards, and state/config emits in the parent.
- Phase 28 moves condition body presentation into `ConditionNodeBody.vue` and the top action/advanced popover presentation into `NodeCardTopActions.vue`; `NodeCard.vue` drops to 2,577 lines while keeping condition drafts, action confirmations, config handlers, lock guards, and graph/state emits in the parent.
- Phase 29 moves primary input/output state-port presentation into `PrimaryStatePort.vue` and the port-reorder floating preview into `FloatingStatePortPill.vue`; `NodeCard.vue` drops to 1,988 lines while keeping state drafts, port validation, lock guards, and graph/state emits in the parent.
- Phase 30 closes the low-risk `NodeCard.vue` P1 gate and starts P2 by moving node drag/resize move projection into `canvasNodeDragResizeModel.ts`; `EditorCanvas.vue` drops to 3,332 lines while keeping pointer capture, animation-frame batching, connection completion, and emits in the component.
- Phase 31 continues P2 by moving node drag/resize refs, pointer-capture release, drag/resize scheduling, and residual click suppression into `useCanvasNodeDragResize.ts`; `EditorCanvas.vue` drops to 3,267 lines while keeping selection, active connection cleanup, panning, DOM measurement, and graph mutation emits in the component.
- Do not commit runtime artifacts such as `backend/data/settings`, `.dev_*`, `dist`, or `.worktrees`.
- After code changes, restart using `npm run dev`.

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Structure test still expected the old inline forced-edge-id block | Focused post-implementation run | Updated the assertion to verify the extracted `buildForceVisibleProjectedEdgeIds` boundary and flow confirm id input. |
| Virtual any output drags no longer auto-snapped to new agent inputs after cleanup | Baseline comparison against `8017081` | Restored virtual output pending-source preservation in `buildPendingAgentInputSourceByNodeId`, added regression coverage, and extracted follow-up interaction helpers into `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.ts`. |
| `vue-tsc` flagged unused NodeCard destructures and mock DOM type gaps after `usePortReorder` extraction | Phase 19 TypeScript verification | Stopped destructuring global pointer handlers/pointer state in `NodeCard.vue`, made test source elements satisfy `EventTarget`, and narrowed query results inside `usePortReorder.ts`. |
| Agent prompt textarea lost parent scoped surface styling after moving into `AgentNodeBody.vue` | Phase 25 visual screenshot | Moved the required surface/textarea styles into `AgentNodeBody.vue` and added structure coverage for the local scoped style. |
| Root `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` printed TypeScript help instead of checking the project | Phase 26 TypeScript verification | Re-ran the unused-symbol check through `frontend/node_modules/.bin/vue-tsc` from the `frontend` directory, which completed with exit 0 and no diagnostics. |
| `ConditionNodeBody.vue` and `NodeCardTopActions.vue` were missing during the Phase 28 red test | First focused structure run before implementation | Added both child components and reran focused structure/model tests successfully. |
| Unescaped backticks in `rg` shell commands triggered `/bin/bash: line 1: NodeCard.vue: command not found` | Phase 28 source inspection and plan sanity-check commands | Re-ran inspection with safer quoting; no code was changed by the failed shell interpolation. |
| Fresh screenshot tooling probe found no `chromium`, `playwright`, or `puppeteer` available from the current shell | Final visual-check refresh after dev restart | Kept the Phase 28 screenshots already captured earlier in this round and used fresh HTTP health checks for final dev verification. |
| `vue-tsc` flagged an unused `nodeDrag` destructure after the Phase 31 composable extraction | Phase 31 TypeScript verification | Stopped destructuring `nodeDrag` in `EditorCanvas.vue` and updated the structure test to assert that the drag ref stays owned by the composable. |
