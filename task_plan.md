# Task Plan: Repository Cleanup Execution Rounds 21-30

## Goal
Run a ten-round conservative cleanup batch focused on `EditorCanvas.vue` pure projection and interaction-model helpers, then close the baseline interaction regressions in one larger pass while preserving graph editing behavior, runtime visuals, drag/connect workflows, deletion behavior, and dev startup health.

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Make the next batch exactly ten cleanup rounds | The user explicitly asked to increase the next round count to ten. |
| Stay mostly inside `EditorCanvas.vue` | It remains a large mixed-responsibility component, and the selected helpers are pure enough to test without UI risk. |
| Avoid backend runtime refactors in this batch | Backend executor/provider files need broader behavior fixtures and are higher risk than the current canvas projection helpers. |
| Keep side effects local | DOM measurement, refs, timers, emits, lock guards, and viewport mutation stay in the component. |

## Notes
- Clean baseline: `main...origin/main` after `8017081 更新第十八至二十轮清理进度`.
- `EditorCanvas.vue` starts this batch at 4,226 lines.
- The previous production build completed without a large chunk warning.
- This batch leaves `EditorCanvas.vue` at 4,039 lines, down from 4,226 at the batch start.
- The baseline interaction repair pass leaves `EditorCanvas.vue` at 3,848 lines by moving connection auto-snap and creation payload decisions into a tested model.
- Phase 15 leaves `EditorCanvas.vue` at 3,363 lines by moving edge popover interaction state and node measurement state into composables.
- Phase 16 moves NodeCard title/description editing state into `useNodeCardTextEditor.ts`; `NodeCard.vue` drops from 5,095 to 4,930 lines before final verification.
- Do not commit runtime artifacts such as `backend/data/settings`, `.dev_*`, `dist`, or `.worktrees`.
- After code changes, restart using `npm run dev`.

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Structure test still expected the old inline forced-edge-id block | Focused post-implementation run | Updated the assertion to verify the extracted `buildForceVisibleProjectedEdgeIds` boundary and flow confirm id input. |
| Virtual any output drags no longer auto-snapped to new agent inputs after cleanup | Baseline comparison against `8017081` | Restored virtual output pending-source preservation in `buildPendingAgentInputSourceByNodeId`, added regression coverage, and extracted follow-up interaction helpers into `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.ts`. |
