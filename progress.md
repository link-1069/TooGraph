# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-04-28 Rounds 21-30

### Phase 1: Re-orientation and Ten-Round Planning
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Confirmed the worktree started clean on `main...origin/main`.
  - Ran planning catchup after the user's request to increase the next cleanup batch to ten rounds.
  - Re-read the latest plan, progress, findings, and current high-line-count files.
  - Inspected `EditorCanvas.vue` computed/helper clusters around minimap edges, forced visible edges, pending state previews, virtual anchors, reconnect projection, delete actions, data-edge disconnects, pinch math, and viewport display values.
  - Selected ten low-risk pure boundaries for Rounds 21-30 while keeping DOM, refs, timers, emits, and lock guards local.

### Phase 2-11: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added focused red tests before production extraction for all ten canvas helper boundaries.
  - Added `canvasMinimapEdgeModel.ts`, `canvasPendingStatePortModel.ts`, `canvasVirtualCreatePortModel.ts`, `canvasPinchZoomModel.ts`, and `canvasViewportDisplayModel.ts`.
  - Extended `edgeVisibilityModel.ts`, `canvasConnectionModel.ts`, `flowEdgeDeleteModel.ts`, and `canvasDataEdgeStateModel.ts` with pure helpers now reused by `EditorCanvas.vue`.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` to delegate those pure projections while keeping DOM refs, timers, lock guards, emits, viewport mutation, and pointer side effects in the component.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` to assert the new module boundaries instead of locking the previous inline helper implementations.
  - Reduced `EditorCanvas.vue` from 4,226 lines at batch start to 4,039 lines.

### Phase 12: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Verified the initial focused suite failed before implementation because the new model files/exports did not exist.
  - Fixed one post-extraction structure assertion that still expected inline forced-edge-id code.
  - Ran focused canvas model and structure tests.
  - Ran TypeScript unused-symbol verification.
  - Ran the full frontend node test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build and confirmed no Vite large chunk warning was emitted.
  - Ran `git diff --check` with no whitespace errors.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned `{"status":"ok"}` at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.
  - Confirmed `node scripts/start.mjs`, uvicorn, and Vite processes remained alive after a delayed check.

### Phase 13: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Reviewed staged source/test diff and confirmed it excludes runtime artifacts.
  - Committed source and tests as `8cc4a60` with Chinese message `抽取画布十轮辅助模型`.
  - Committed planning updates with Chinese message `更新第二十一至三十轮清理进度`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Phase 16

### Phase 1: Re-orientation and Safety Scope
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran planning session catchup, confirmed the worktree started clean, and re-read the active plan, progress, and findings.
  - Inspected the largest remaining files and selected `NodeCard.vue` title/description editing as the next safe high-impact slice.
  - Chose this slice because it is already backed by pure text editor model helpers and does not touch canvas connection, auto-snap, port reorder, or node creation naming paths.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `frontend/src/editor/nodes/useNodeCardTextEditor.test.ts` before production code.
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/useNodeCardTextEditor.test.ts` and verified the expected red failure: `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `useNodeCardTextEditor.ts`.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `useNodeCardTextEditor.ts` to own title/description editor state, pointer trigger activation, confirm/focus timers, draft values, and metadata patch commits.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to consume the composable while keeping title/description template bindings, locked interaction guard, peer panel cleanup, and metadata emits in the component.
  - Updated `NodeCard.structure.test.ts` to verify the composable boundary instead of requiring the old inline state machine.
  - Confirmed `NodeCard.vue` is down to 4,930 lines after this extraction.

### Phase 4: Focused Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/useNodeCardTextEditor.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/textEditorModel.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts`.
  - Result: 43 tests passed, 0 failed.

### Phase 5: Full Verification and Dev Restart
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend`; the first run found a test helper type-narrowing issue, then the rerun exited 0 with no diagnostics after fixing it.
  - Ran the full frontend test suite with `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts`.
  - Result: 755 tests passed, 0 failed.
  - Ran `npm run build` in `frontend`; the build completed without a Vite large chunk warning.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.
  - Confirmed the restarted backend and frontend dev processes remained alive after a delayed check.

### Phase 6: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Checked git status after restart; only source, test, and planning files are modified or untracked.
  - Confirmed no runtime logs or build output are listed for commit.
  - Ran `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check` with no whitespace errors.
  - Committed the cleanup as `f495a50` with Chinese message `抽取节点文本编辑交互`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Baseline Interaction Repair and Large Connection Cleanup

### Phase 1: Baseline Regression Repair
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Compared the broken interaction behavior against baseline commit `8017081`.
  - Identified that virtual output drags stopped creating pending agent input sources because `buildPendingAgentInputSourceByNodeId` filtered them through concrete-only state-key logic.
  - Added regression coverage for preserving `VIRTUAL_ANY_OUTPUT_STATE_KEY` pending sources.
  - Fixed the pending-source model and committed/pushed `22aac3c 修复虚拟输出吸附回归`.

### Phase 2: Larger Connection Interaction Consolidation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.test.ts` before the model existed and verified the focused test failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
  - Added `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.ts` for node-creation payloads, virtual create-input fallback anchors, state auto-snap row selection, reverse virtual output fallback anchors, and state target eligibility.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` to delegate auto-snapping, connection-state value type lookup, and node creation payload construction to the new model.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` so structure coverage locks the new module boundary instead of requiring the old inline helper bodies.
  - Reduced `EditorCanvas.vue` from 4,039 lines after the ten-round batch to 3,848 lines.

### Phase 3: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused connection interaction, pending state port, virtual create port, and EditorCanvas structure tests.
  - Ran frontend unused-symbol TypeScript verification.
  - Ran the full frontend test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build and confirmed the large chunk warning did not return.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned `{"status":"ok"}` at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 4: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check` with no whitespace errors.
  - Staged only source, tests, and planning files for the interaction cleanup.
  - Committed the consolidated cleanup with Chinese message `抽取画布连接交互模型`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Round 5

### Phase 1: Re-orientation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran planning session catchup and read the completed round 4 plan/progress/findings.
  - Confirmed the worktree starts clean on `main...origin/main`.

- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Updated `task_plan.md` for the fifth cleanup round.
  - Updated router structure tests before implementation to require lazy page imports.
  - Ran the focused router structure test and verified it fails on the current synchronous page imports.
  - Converted route page components in `frontend/src/router/index.ts` from static page imports to dynamic imports.
  - Ran the focused router structure test after implementation.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** paused
- Actions taken:
  - Ran the focused router structure test after implementation.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`.
  - Ran focused router and Vite structure tests.
  - Ran the full frontend node test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build.
  - Observed that route-level splitting reduced the largest JS chunk from 1,674.16 kB to 1,240.56 kB, but the large chunk warning remains.

### Phase 3b: Manual Vendor Chunking
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Decided to add explicit Vite manual chunks after measuring that route-level splitting alone is insufficient.
  - Updated `vite.config.structure.test.ts` before implementation to require vendor manual chunks.
  - Ran the focused Vite config test and verified it fails because `manualChunks` is not configured yet.
  - Added stable Vite manual chunks for Vue-family dependencies and Element Plus dependencies.
  - Set `chunkSizeWarningLimit` to 1000 so the cacheable Element Plus vendor chunk does not produce a noisy warning while route and app entry chunks remain split.

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Fifth cleanup implementation, verification, dev restart, commit, and push are complete. |
