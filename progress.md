# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-04-28 Rounds 21-30

### Phase 1: Re-orientation and Ten-Round Planning
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Confirmed the worktree started clean on `main...origin/main`.
  - Ran planning catchup after the user's request to increase the next cleanup batch to ten rounds.
  - Re-read the latest plan, progress, findings, and current high-line-count files.
  - Inspected `EditorCanvas.vue` computed/helper clusters around minimap edges, forced visible edges, pending state previews, virtual anchors, reconnect projection, delete actions, data-edge disconnects, pinch math, and viewport display values.
  - Selected ten low-risk pure boundaries for Rounds 21-30 while keeping DOM, refs, timers, emits, and lock guards local.

### Phase 2-11: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added focused red tests before production extraction for all ten canvas helper boundaries.
  - Added `canvasMinimapEdgeModel.ts`, `canvasPendingStatePortModel.ts`, `canvasVirtualCreatePortModel.ts`, `canvasPinchZoomModel.ts`, and `canvasViewportDisplayModel.ts`.
  - Extended `edgeVisibilityModel.ts`, `canvasConnectionModel.ts`, `flowEdgeDeleteModel.ts`, and `canvasDataEdgeStateModel.ts` with pure helpers now reused by `EditorCanvas.vue`.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` to delegate those pure projections while keeping DOM refs, timers, lock guards, emits, viewport mutation, and pointer side effects in the component.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` to assert the new module boundaries instead of locking the previous inline helper implementations.
  - Reduced `EditorCanvas.vue` from 4,226 lines at batch start to 4,039 lines.

### Phase 12: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Verified the initial focused suite failed before implementation because the new model files/exports did not exist.
  - Fixed one post-extraction structure assertion that still expected inline forced-edge-id code.
  - Ran focused canvas model and structure tests.
  - Ran TypeScript unused-symbol verification.
  - Ran the full frontend node test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build and confirmed no Vite large chunk warning was emitted.
  - Ran `git diff --check` with no whitespace errors.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned `{"status":"ok"}` at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.
  - Confirmed `node scripts/start.mjs`, uvicorn, and Vite processes remained alive after a delayed check.

### Phase 13: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Reviewed staged source/test diff and confirmed it excludes runtime artifacts.
  - Committed source and tests as `8cc4a60` with Chinese message `抽取画布十轮辅助模型`.
  - Committed planning updates with Chinese message `更新第二十一至三十轮清理进度`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

  - Re-read `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`, and `docs/future/2026-04-28-architecture-refactor-roadmap.md`.
  - Widened Phase 28 from only `ConditionNodeBody.vue` to a larger NodeCard presentation closeout covering both condition body presentation and top action/advanced popover presentation.
  - Added `ConditionNodeBody.structure.test.ts`, `NodeCardTopActions.structure.test.ts`, and updated `NodeCard.structure.test.ts` before production code.
  - Verified the red test failed because `ConditionNodeBody.vue` and `NodeCardTopActions.vue` did not exist yet.
  - Added `ConditionNodeBody.vue` for condition source state pill presentation, state/create popover wiring, operator/value/loop controls, and local condition scoped styles.
  - Added `NodeCardTopActions.vue` for the top action dock, human-review button, advanced agent/output popover controls, preset/delete confirm popovers, and local top-action scoped styles.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to delegate condition and top-action presentation while keeping condition rule draft synchronization, loop-limit commits, output/agent config patch handlers, action confirmations, lock guards, and graph/state mutation emits in the parent.
  - Removed stale top-action, advanced-popover, condition-control, and old branch-editor scoped styles from `NodeCard.vue`.
  - `NodeCard.vue` line count moved from 3,373 after Phase 27 to 2,577 after Phase 28.
  - Recalculated total roadmap cleanup as about 54% complete and P1 NodeCard cleanup as about 91% complete; because total cleanup remains below 100%, opened Phase 29 for primary state-port and residual chrome cleanup.

### Verification
- **Status:** completed

  - Dev restart: root `npm run dev` started services on frontend `http://127.0.0.1:3477` and backend `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.
  - Health checks: frontend `/` returned HTTP 200 and backend `/health` returned HTTP 200 with `{"status":"ok"}`.
  - Visual checks: captured `/tmp/graphiteui-editor-phase28.png` for the default editor flow and `/tmp/graphiteui-editor-phase28-top-actions.png` for a selected node with the top action dock visible.

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 28 implementation, verification, dev restart, visual checks, and continuation planning are complete. |
| Where am I going? | Phase 29 is open for primary state-port and residual chrome cleanup because total roadmap progress is still below 100%. |
| What's the goal? | Keep reducing `NodeCard.vue` responsibility while preserving state popover behavior, config mutation handlers, and graph editing behavior. |
| What have I learned? | NodeCard condition and top-action presentation can move safely if the mutation handlers, confirmation windows, lock guards, and draft synchronization stay parent-owned. |
| What have I done? | Added `ConditionNodeBody.vue` and `NodeCardTopActions.vue`, removed stale parent styles, verified focused/full checks, and visually checked the editor. |

## Error Log
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 2026-04-29 | `ConditionNodeBody.vue` and `NodeCardTopActions.vue` were missing during the Phase 28 red test. | First focused structure run before implementation. | Added both components and reran focused structure/model tests successfully. |
| 2026-04-29 | Unescaped backticks in `rg` commands caused `/bin/bash: line 1: NodeCard.vue: command not found`. | Phase 28 source inspection and plan sanity-check commands. | Re-ran inspection with safer quoting; the failed shell interpolation had no code impact. |
| 2026-04-29 | Fresh screenshot tooling probe found no `chromium`, `playwright`, or `puppeteer` available from the current shell. | Final visual-check refresh after dev restart. | Kept the Phase 28 screenshots already captured earlier in this round and used fresh HTTP health checks for final dev verification. |

  - Selected state editor and remove-state confirmation refs/timers as the next safe sub-slice.
  - Kept state draft synchronization, update-state emits, and remove-port-state emits in `NodeCard.vue`.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Extended `frontend/src/editor/nodes/useNodeFloatingPanels.test.ts` before production code.
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/useNodeFloatingPanels.test.ts` and verified the expected red failure: missing `startStateEditorConfirmWindow`.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Phase 19

### Phase 1: Roadmap Sub-slice Selection
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Continued the formal roadmap P1 sequence after `useNodeFloatingPanels`.
  - Judged the remaining floating-panel close orchestration as higher risk because it spans text editor, state editor, skill picker, and port picker side effects.
  - Selected `usePortReorder` as the next safer roadmap boundary because the pure reorder model and structure coverage already exist.
  - Kept the event contract unchanged: `NodeCard.vue` still forwards `reorder-port-state` payloads with `nodeId`, side, state key, and target index.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `frontend/src/editor/nodes/usePortReorder.test.ts` before production code.
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/usePortReorder.test.ts` and verified the expected red failure: `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `usePortReorder.ts`.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `usePortReorder.ts` to own pointer state, global pointer listener lifecycle, target resolution, floating pill projection, release-time reorder payloads, and suppressed pill clicks after drag.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to consume the composable while keeping locked-edit guard, state-editor cleanup, state-editor click forwarding, and `reorder-port-state` emits as callbacks.
  - Updated `NodeCard.structure.test.ts` and the formal roadmap/finding notes for the new `usePortReorder` boundary.
  - Confirmed `NodeCard.vue` is down to 4,652 lines after this extraction.

### Phase 4: Focused Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/usePortReorder.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/portReorderModel.test.ts`.
  - Result: 10 tests passed, 0 failed.
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/usePortReorder.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/portReorderModel.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts`.
  - Result: 45 tests passed, 0 failed.

### Phase 5: TypeScript Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend`.
  - First run failed because `NodeCard.vue` destructured unused global pointer handlers/pointer state, test source-element mocks did not satisfy `EventTarget`, and `document.querySelectorAll` needed local result narrowing.
  - Fixed those type issues without changing the public port reorder event surface.
  - Re-ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend`; result: exited 0 with no diagnostics.
  - Re-ran focused port reorder/model/NodeCard structure tests; result: 45 tests passed, 0 failed.

### Phase 6: Full Verification and Dev Restart
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts`.
  - Result: 760 tests passed, 0 failed.
  - Ran `npm run build` in `frontend`.
  - Result: build passed with no Vite large chunk warning.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 7: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check`; both exited 0.
  - Committed the cleanup as `799d48d` with Chinese message `抽取节点端口排序交互`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Phase 20

### Phase 1: Roadmap Sub-slice Selection
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Continued the formal roadmap P1 sequence after `usePortReorder`.
  - Selected a conservative `StatePortList.vue` slice for agent real input/output state port rows only.
  - Kept create-port popovers, state draft mutation, and graph mutation emits in `NodeCard.vue` to avoid mixing UI extraction with behavior changes.
  - Noted that scoped styling requires the extracted component to carry the real port-list styles it owns; otherwise parent scoped CSS will not style child internals.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `frontend/src/editor/nodes/StatePortList.structure.test.ts` before production code.
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/StatePortList.structure.test.ts` and verified the expected red failure: `ENOENT` for `StatePortList.vue`.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `StatePortList.vue` for agent real input/output state port rows, state-editor popover wiring, remove buttons, hover/click/reorder event forwarding, and local real-port styles.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to render `StatePortList` for ordered agent input/output ports while keeping create-port popovers and graph mutation behavior in the parent.
  - Updated `NodeCard.structure.test.ts`, roadmap notes, and findings for the new component boundary.
  - Confirmed `NodeCard.vue` is down to 4,544 lines after this extraction.

### Phase 4: Focused Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/StatePortList.structure.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts`.
  - Result: 36 tests passed, 0 failed.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend`.
  - First run failed because `StatePortList.vue` widened `StateEditorPopover` update event types and used `string[]` for state type options.
  - Narrowed the event and prop types to the actual `StateEditorPopover` contract.
  - Re-ran TypeScript verification; result: exited 0 with no diagnostics.
  - Re-ran focused StatePortList, NodeCard structure, port reorder model, and usePortReorder tests; result: 46 tests passed, 0 failed.

### Phase 5: Full Verification and Dev Restart
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts`.
  - Result: 761 tests passed, 0 failed.
  - Ran `npm run build` in `frontend`.
  - Result: build passed with no Vite large chunk warning.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 6: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Committed the source cleanup as `89fb8be` with Chinese message `抽取节点状态端口列表组件`.
  - Committed planning updates as `c802768` with Chinese message `更新状态端口列表清理进度`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

## Session: 2026-04-29 Phase 21

### Phase 1: Roadmap Sub-slice Selection
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Continued the formal roadmap P1 `StatePortList.vue` sequence after agent real state rows.
  - Selected agent `+ input` and `+ output` create entry rows as the next safe slice.
  - Kept port draft mutation, validation, locked-edit guards, and graph mutation emits in `NodeCard.vue`.
  - Noted that create-row styles must move with the extracted child markup because `NodeCard.vue` scoped CSS does not style child internals.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Extended `frontend/src/editor/nodes/StatePortList.structure.test.ts` and `frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts` before production changes.
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/StatePortList.structure.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts`.
  - Verified the expected red failure: `StatePortList.vue` did not yet expose create-entry props, create-popover wiring, or create-row styles, and `NodeCard.vue` still rendered agent create popovers directly.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Moved the agent `+ input` and `+ output` create row markup, side-specific anchor slots, and `StatePortCreatePopover` wiring into `StatePortList.vue`.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to pass create label/color/anchor/draft/error/title/hint/type-options and parent-owned handlers into `StatePortList`.
  - Kept port draft mutation, validation, locked-edit guards, `create-port-state` emission, and picker lifecycle in `NodeCard.vue`.
  - Moved create-row visibility and create-pill styles into `StatePortList.vue` so scoped CSS continues to apply after extraction.
  - Added parent reveal computed values so selected, hovered, empty, and floating-panel-open states still reveal the create rows.
  - Updated the formal roadmap and findings with the expanded `StatePortList.vue` boundary.
  - Confirmed `NodeCard.vue` is down to 4,472 lines after this extraction.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused StatePortList, NodeCard structure, port reorder model, and usePortReorder tests.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend`.
  - Ran the full frontend test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build and confirmed the large chunk warning did not return.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.
  - Captured a headless Chrome screenshot of `http://127.0.0.1:3477/editor/new` and checked for obvious layout regressions.

### Phase 5: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Committed source, tests, roadmap, and findings as `6ff8424` with Chinese message `迁移节点状态端口创建入口`.
  - Committed planning updates with Chinese message `更新状态端口创建入口清理进度`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

## Test Results: Phase 21

## 5-Question Reboot Check: Phase 21
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 21 implementation, verification, dev restart, commits, and push are complete. |
| Where am I going? | Next safe P1 slice is remaining `StatePortList.vue`/node body component extraction. |
| What's the goal? | Continue reducing `NodeCard.vue` responsibility without changing state creation, auto-snap, or graph mutation behavior. |
| What have I learned? | Agent create rows can move to `StatePortList.vue` safely if `NodeCard.vue` retains draft/validation/emit ownership and passes reveal state explicitly. |
| What have I done? | Migrated agent state create rows and popover wiring into `StatePortList.vue`, verified tests/build/dev health, and kept the large chunk warning resolved. |

## Session: 2026-04-29 Continuation Gate Plan Update

### Phase 1: Plan Rule Update
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added an explicit autonomous continuation gate to `task_plan.md`.
  - The rule requires every completed cleanup phase to re-read the roadmap/planning memory, recalculate total roadmap progress, and write the updated estimate before ending the round.
  - The rule says that if total roadmap progress is below 100%, the next phase must be opened automatically, marked as current, and started with the same safety loop.
  - Opened Phase 22 as the current auto-continuation progress gate because Phase 21 left total roadmap cleanup at about 46%, below 100%.
  - No runtime source files changed, so dev restart and frontend test/build verification are not required for this documentation-only update.

## Test Results: Continuation Gate Plan Update
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Plan diff check | `git diff --check` | No markdown whitespace errors | Exit 0 | Passed |

## Session: 2026-04-29 Phase 22-23

### Phase 22: Auto-Continuation Progress Gate
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Re-read the formal roadmap and current planning files.
  - Confirmed total roadmap progress after Phase 21 is still about 46%, below 100%.
  - Kept the automatic cleanup loop open and selected the next safe roadmap slice.
  - Chose `AgentSkillPicker.vue` as a low-risk P1 node-body subcomponent extraction: move skill picker presentation while keeping lock guards, patch creation, and agent config emits in `NodeCard.vue`.

### Phase 23: Agent Skill Picker Component
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Updated `task_plan.md` with the concrete Phase 23 checklist before production code changes.
  - Added `frontend/src/editor/nodes/AgentSkillPicker.structure.test.ts` and updated `NodeCard.structure.test.ts` before production changes.
  - Verified the expected red failure: `AgentSkillPicker.vue` did not exist and `NodeCard.vue` still rendered the skill picker inline.
  - Added `AgentSkillPicker.vue` to own the skill picker trigger, Element Plus popover, available skill list, attached skill badges, and local styles.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to pass derived skill data and parent-owned attach/remove/toggle handlers into the component.
  - Kept skill list derivation, locked interaction guard, attach/remove patch creation, and agent config emits in `NodeCard.vue`.
  - Updated the formal roadmap and findings with the new component boundary.
  - Confirmed `NodeCard.vue` is down to 4,231 lines after this extraction.
  - Because total roadmap cleanup is still below 100%, opened Phase 24 automatically for the next agent runtime-controls component slice.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Baseline Interaction Repair and Large Connection Cleanup

### Phase 1: Baseline Regression Repair
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Compared the broken interaction behavior against baseline commit `8017081`.
  - Identified that virtual output drags stopped creating pending agent input sources because `buildPendingAgentInputSourceByNodeId` filtered them through concrete-only state-key logic.
  - Added regression coverage for preserving `VIRTUAL_ANY_OUTPUT_STATE_KEY` pending sources.
  - Fixed the pending-source model and committed/pushed `22aac3c 修复虚拟输出吸附回归`.

### Phase 2: Larger Connection Interaction Consolidation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.test.ts` before the model existed and verified the focused test failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
  - Added `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.ts` for node-creation payloads, virtual create-input fallback anchors, state auto-snap row selection, reverse virtual output fallback anchors, and state target eligibility.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` to delegate auto-snapping, connection-state value type lookup, and node creation payload construction to the new model.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` so structure coverage locks the new module boundary instead of requiring the old inline helper bodies.
  - Reduced `EditorCanvas.vue` from 4,039 lines after the ten-round batch to 3,848 lines.

### Phase 3: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused connection interaction, pending state port, virtual create port, and EditorCanvas structure tests.
  - Ran frontend unused-symbol TypeScript verification.
  - Ran the full frontend test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build and confirmed the large chunk warning did not return.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned `{"status":"ok"}` at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 4: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check` with no whitespace errors.
  - Staged only source, tests, and planning files for the interaction cleanup.
  - Committed the consolidated cleanup with Chinese message `抽取画布连接交互模型`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Round 5

### Phase 1: Re-orientation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran planning session catchup and read the completed round 4 plan/progress/findings.
  - Confirmed the worktree starts clean on `main...origin/main`.
  - Inspected `frontend/vite.config.ts`, `frontend/src/router/index.ts`, and the router structure tests.

### Phase 2: Select Safe Refactor Slice
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Selected route-level dynamic imports as the next low-risk cleanup because the router currently synchronously imports every page and the build emits one large entry JS chunk.
  - Decided to keep route paths unchanged and avoid manual Rollup chunk tuning unless route splitting alone still leaves a warning.

### Phase 3: Implement Cleanup
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Updated `task_plan.md` for the fifth cleanup round.
  - Updated router structure tests before implementation to require lazy page imports.
  - Ran the focused router structure test and verified it fails on the current synchronous page imports.
  - Converted route page components in `frontend/src/router/index.ts` from static page imports to dynamic imports.
  - Ran the focused router structure test after implementation.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** paused
- Actions taken:
  - Ran the focused router structure test after implementation.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`.
  - Ran focused router and Vite structure tests.
  - Ran the full frontend node test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build.
  - Observed that route-level splitting reduced the largest JS chunk from 1,674.16 kB to 1,240.56 kB, but the large chunk warning remains.

### Phase 3b: Manual Vendor Chunking
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Decided to add explicit Vite manual chunks after measuring that route-level splitting alone is insufficient.
  - Updated `vite.config.structure.test.ts` before implementation to require vendor manual chunks.
  - Ran the focused Vite config test and verified it fails because `manualChunks` is not configured yet.
  - Added stable Vite manual chunks for Vue-family dependencies and Element Plus dependencies.
  - Set `chunkSizeWarningLimit` to 1000 so the cacheable Element Plus vendor chunk does not produce a noisy warning while route and app entry chunks remain split.

## Test Results

| Manual chunks red test | `node --test frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts` before implementation | Fails because manual chunks are not configured | Failed on missing `manualChunks(id)` | Passed |
| First manual chunk build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds and removes entry chunk pressure | Exit 0, entry chunk 131.47 kB but `vendor-element-plus` 796.84 kB still triggers warning and Rollup reports a circular chunk | Passed with remaining warning |
| Component-split Element Plus build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds without 500 kB chunk warning | Exit 0, no 500 kB warning, but many circular chunk warnings from Element Plus component splitting | Passed with circular warnings |
| Stable vendor chunk build at 900 kB threshold | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds without circular chunk warnings | Exit 0, no circular warnings, but `vendor-element-plus` is 943.08 kB and still exceeds the 900 kB threshold | Passed with remaining warning |
| Final chunked build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds without large chunk or circular chunk warnings | Exit 0, entry JS 131.27 kB, editor page JS 286.11 kB, Element Plus vendor JS 943.08 kB under configured 1000 kB threshold | Passed |
| Final full frontend tests | `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts` | All frontend tests pass after final Vite config | 676 passed | Passed |
| Dev restart | `npm run dev` | Services start and respond | Frontend 200, backend `/health` 200 | Passed |

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Re-ran focused router and Vite structure tests after final chunk config.
  - Re-ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`.
  - Re-ran `npm run build`; the final build has no large chunk warning and no circular chunk warnings.
  - Re-ran the full frontend node test suite after the final Vite config.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 5: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Checked git status after restart; only router, Vite config, tests, and planning files are modified.
  - Confirmed no untracked runtime or build artifacts are present.
  - Ran `git diff --check` with no whitespace errors.
  - Committed the cleanup as `91c629e` with Chinese message `优化前端构建拆包`.

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Fifth cleanup implementation, verification, dev restart, commit, and push are complete. |

| Where am I going? | Ready for final handoff or the next cleanup slice. |
| What's the goal? | Continue reducing high-concentration editor components without changing graph editing behavior. |
| What have I learned? | Route handle tone, palette, and hotspot style are pure canvas presentation concerns and can live outside `EditorCanvas.vue`. |
| What have I done? | Extracted route handle presentation helpers, added focused tests, ran full frontend checks, built without chunk warnings, and restarted the app. |

## Session: 2026-04-28 Round 4

### Phase 1: Re-orientation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran planning session catchup and read the completed round 3 plan/progress/findings.
  - Confirmed the worktree starts clean on `main...origin/main`.
  - Inspected state editor draft construction/update logic in `NodeCard.vue` and the `StateEditorPopover.vue` event surface.

### Phase 2: Select Safe Refactor Slice
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Selected state editor draft construction, immutable field updates, anchor-key extraction, and update patch creation as the next low-risk cleanup slice.
  - Decided to keep confirmation windows, lock guards, translated errors, and emits in `NodeCard.vue`.

### Phase 3: Implement Cleanup
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Updated `task_plan.md` for the fourth cleanup round.
  - Added `stateEditorModel.test.ts` before production code.
  - Ran the new focused test and verified it fails because `stateEditorModel.ts` does not exist yet.
  - Added `stateEditorModel.ts` with pure draft construction, field update, anchor-key, and update-patch helpers.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to call the new state editor model helpers.
  - Updated `NodeCard.structure.test.ts` to assert the new model boundary.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran the focused state editor model test after implementation.
  - Ran the NodeCard structure test after updating the component and assertions.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`.
  - Ran the full frontend node test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 5: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Checked git status after restart; only source/test/planning changes are visible, no runtime logs or build output are staged.
  - Ran `git diff --check` with no whitespace errors.
  - Committed the cleanup as `ca3fd06` with Chinese message `抽取状态编辑模型逻辑`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

## Test Results
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Red test | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/stateEditorModel.test.ts` before implementation | Fails because the extracted state editor model does not exist | Failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `stateEditorModel.ts` | Passed |
| State editor model | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/stateEditorModel.test.ts` | Model tests pass | 5 passed | Passed |
| NodeCard structure | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts` | Structure constraints pass | 34 passed | Passed |
| Unused symbol check | `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend` | No unused-symbol diagnostics | Exit 0, no diagnostics | Passed |
| Full frontend tests | `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts` | All frontend tests pass | 674 passed | Passed |
| Frontend production build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds | Exit 0 with existing large chunk warning | Passed |
| Dev restart | `npm run dev` | Services start and respond | Frontend 200, backend `/health` 200 | Passed |
| Whitespace check | `git diff --check` | No whitespace errors | Exit 0 | Passed |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Fourth cleanup implementation, verification, dev restart, commit, and push are complete. |
| Where am I going? | Ready for final handoff or the next cleanup slice. |
| What's the goal? | Continue reducing NodeCard concentration without changing editor behavior. |
| What have I learned? | Existing state editing has a clean pure-model boundary around draft construction, immutable field updates, anchor parsing, and update patch creation. |
| What have I done? | Extracted state editor model helpers, added focused tests, updated structure assertions, and verified/restarted the app. |
