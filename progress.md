# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-04-28 Round 2

### Phase 1: Re-orientation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran planning session catchup and confirmed the previous cleanup and push are reflected in the repository.
  - Read current plan, findings, progress, and git status.
  - Confirmed the worktree starts clean on `main...origin/main`.
  - Inspected `NodeCard.vue` title/description editing logic and its existing structure test.

### Phase 2: Select Safe Refactor Slice
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Selected text editor pure logic extraction as the second cleanup slice.
  - Kept focus management, timeout management, lock guards, and event emission inside `NodeCard.vue`.

### Phase 3: Implement Cleanup
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `frontend/src/editor/nodes/textEditorModel.test.ts` first and verified it failed because `textEditorModel.ts` did not exist.
  - Added `frontend/src/editor/nodes/textEditorModel.ts` for field chrome values, draft lookup, open-state helpers, pointer movement threshold logic, and metadata patch calculation.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to use the model helpers while preserving template bindings and emitted `update-node-metadata` event shape.
  - Updated `NodeCard.structure.test.ts` to assert the new module boundary.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran the new text editor model test after implementation.
  - Ran `NodeCard.structure.test.ts` after updating structure expectations.
  - Ran focused text editor and NodeCard tests together.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit`.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`.
  - Ran the full frontend node test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 5: Commit and Push
- **Status:** in_progress
- Actions taken:
  - Checked git status after restart; only source/planning changes are visible, no runtime logs or build output are staged.

## Test Results
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Red test | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/textEditorModel.test.ts` before implementation | Fails because the new module is missing | Failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `textEditorModel.ts` | Passed |
| Text editor model | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/textEditorModel.test.ts` | New model tests pass | 6 passed | Passed |

| TypeScript check | `npx vue-tsc --noEmit` in `frontend` | No type errors | Exit 0, no diagnostics | Passed |
| Unused symbol check | `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend` | No unused-symbol diagnostics | Exit 0, no diagnostics | Passed |
| Focused frontend tests | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/textEditorModel.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts` | Touched surface tests pass | 40 passed | Passed |
| Full frontend tests | `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts` | All frontend tests pass | 666 passed | Passed |

## Error Log
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Commit and push phase. |
| Where am I going? | Review diff/status, commit with a Chinese message, and push. |
| What's the goal? | Continue reducing NodeCard concentration without changing user-visible behavior. |
| What have I learned? | Title/description edit behavior has a stable pure boundary around draft lookup, pointer activation, and metadata patch calculation. |
| What have I done? | Extracted and tested `textEditorModel.ts`, then updated NodeCard to use it. |
