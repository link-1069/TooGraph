# Progress Log

## Session: 2026-04-30 Phase 58

### Phase 1: Re-orientation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Confirmed Phase 57 was committed and pushed as `7ee851f`.
  - Re-read the formal roadmap, active plan, latest findings, and current `updatePinchZoom` flow.
  - Inspected `canvasPinchZoomModel.ts`, `canvasPinchZoomModel.test.ts`, and pinch/viewport structure coverage.
  - Selected the next P2 Canvas boundary: pinch-zoom update action projection.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `resolveCanvasPinchZoomUpdateAction` expectations before production code.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` to require delegated pinch update cleanup/ignore/zoom request projection.
  - Verified the expected red failure: the pinch update export and component wiring did not exist yet.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `CanvasPinchZoomUpdateAction`, `CanvasPinchZoomUpdateRequest`, and `resolveCanvasPinchZoomUpdateAction` in `canvasPinchZoomModel.ts`.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` so `updatePinchZoom` delegates missing pinch, missing pointer/canvas, non-positive distance, and zoom request decisions to the model.
  - Kept active pointer cache updates, DOM canvas rect lookup, actual `clearPinchZoom`, and viewport `zoomAt` mutation inside `EditorCanvas.vue`.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused pinch model and structure tests.
  - Ran broader pinch, viewport display/interaction, minimap, focus, selection, and structure regression tests.
  - Ran TypeScript unused-symbol verification from `frontend`.
  - Ran the full frontend `node --test` suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build; no large chunk warning was emitted.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed backend `/health` returned `{"status":"ok"}` and the frontend entry returned HTTP 200.
  - Captured a headless Chrome screenshot after a virtual-time wait and confirmed the workspace rendered normally.

### Phase 5: Continuation Gate
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Recalculated overall roadmap cleanup at about 85%.
  - Recalculated P2 `EditorCanvas.vue` cleanup at about 86%.
  - Opened Phase 59 automatically because total roadmap progress is below 100%.
  - Selected the next candidate boundary as pinch pointer-release routing around released pinch pointer cleanup/end-pan versus normal pointer-up continuation.

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 58 implementation, verification, docs update, and dev restart are complete. |
| Where am I going? | Phase 59 is open for pinch pointer-release action projection. |
| What's the goal? | Continue reducing `EditorCanvas.vue` pinch/viewport ownership without changing touch pinch behavior, panning teardown, pointer capture release, connection pointer-up, node drag/resize, or graph editing behavior. |
| What have I learned? | Pinch update has a clean model boundary: missing pinch/target cleanup, distance validation, center calculation, and `zoomAt` request projection are pure. |
| What have I done? | Extracted pinch update actions, added focused tests, verified the full frontend suite, built, restarted, and visually smoked the app. |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 52 implementation, verification, docs update, and dev restart are complete. |
| Where am I going? | Phase 53 is open for pending-connection creation-menu action extraction. |
| What's the goal? | Continue reducing `EditorCanvas.vue` interaction ownership without changing drag, resize, snap, create-node, pan/zoom, edge deletion, lock handling, or connection-completion behavior. |
| What have I learned? | Edge pointer-down routing can be pure; the component should keep all edge confirm and selection side effects. |
| What have I done? | Extracted edge pointer-down routing, added focused tests, verified the full frontend suite, built, restarted, and visually smoked the app. |

## Session: 2026-04-30 Phase 51

### Phase 1: Re-orientation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Confirmed Phase 50 was committed and pushed as `1e90c9c`.
  - Re-read the formal roadmap, active plan, latest findings, and current generic locked-canvas guard.
  - Inspected `guardLockedCanvasInteraction`, its edge/toolbar callers, and existing structure coverage around locked human-review graphs.
  - Selected the next P2 Canvas boundary: generic locked-interaction guard action policy.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `resolveLockedCanvasInteractionGuardAction` expectations before production code.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` to require the new generic locked guard model boundary.
  - Verified the expected red failure: the model export and component wiring did not exist yet.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `LockedCanvasInteractionGuardAction` and `resolveLockedCanvasInteractionGuardAction` in `canvasLockedInteractionModel.ts`.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` so `guardLockedCanvasInteraction` delegates allow/block and cleanup policy to the model.
  - Kept actual cleanup calls, selected-edge mutation, and `locked-edit-attempt` emit inside the component.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused locked-interaction model and structure tests.
  - Ran the broader Canvas connection, edge visibility, flow-edge delete, graph document, and locked interaction regression set.
  - Ran TypeScript unused-symbol verification from `frontend`.
  - Ran the full frontend `node --test` suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build; no large chunk warning was emitted.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed backend `/health` returned `{"status":"ok"}` and the frontend entry returned HTTP 200.
  - Captured a headless Chrome screenshot after a virtual-time wait and confirmed the workspace rendered normally.

### Phase 5: Continuation Gate
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Recalculated overall roadmap cleanup at about 78%.
  - Recalculated P2 `EditorCanvas.vue` cleanup at about 79%.
  - Opened Phase 52 automatically because total roadmap progress is below 100%.
  - Selected the next candidate boundary as edge pointer-down routing around locked edit, edge confirm actions, selected-edge toggle, and pending edge preview policy.

  - Added `CanvasDropCreationAction`, `CanvasFileDropCreationPayload`, and `resolveCanvasDropCreationAction` to `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.ts`.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` to route file-drop creation through the returned action.
  - Kept DOM target inspection, `dataTransfer` access, canvas coordinate conversion, and actual `create-node-from-file` / `locked-edit-attempt` emits inside the component.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused connection interaction model and structure tests.
  - Ran the broader Canvas creation, connection, viewport, drag/resize, edge, and graph regression set.
  - Ran TypeScript unused-symbol verification from `frontend`.
  - Ran the full frontend `node --test` suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build; no large chunk warning was emitted.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed backend `/health` returned `{"status":"ok"}` and the frontend entry returned HTTP 200.
  - Captured a headless Chrome screenshot after a virtual-time wait and confirmed the workspace rendered normally.

### Phase 5: Continuation Gate
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Recalculated overall roadmap cleanup at about 72%.
  - Recalculated P2 `EditorCanvas.vue` cleanup at about 73%.
  - Opened Phase 46 automatically because total roadmap progress is below 100%.
  - Selected the next candidate boundary as drag-over drop-effect routing around locked edit, dragged-file availability, and copy/none effect selection.

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 45 implementation, verification, docs update, and dev restart are complete. |
| Where am I going? | Phase 46 is open for drag-over drop-effect request extraction. |
| What's the goal? | Continue reducing `EditorCanvas.vue` interaction ownership without changing drag, resize, snap, create-node, pan/zoom, or connection-completion behavior. |
| What have I learned? | File-drop creation has a clean model boundary around branch selection, while DOM target inspection, file access, coordinate conversion, and emits should remain component-owned. |
| What have I done? | Extracted file-drop creation routing, added focused tests, verified the full frontend suite, built, restarted, and visually smoked the app. |

## Session: 2026-04-29 Phase 38

### Phase 1: Re-orientation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Confirmed Phase 37 was committed and pushed as `8d775e7`.
  - Re-read the formal roadmap, active plan, latest findings, and progress memory.
  - Inspected `handleCanvasPointerMove`, the active-connection hover sync helper, and adjacent connection interaction tests.
  - Selected the next P2 Canvas boundary: active-connection pointer-move preview request projection.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `resolveCanvasConnectionPointerMoveRequest` model expectations before production code.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` to require the new pointer-move request boundary and removal of the old local hover-sync helper.
  - Verified the expected red failure: the model export was missing and the component still had the old inline pointer-move branch.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `CanvasConnectionPointerMoveRequest` and `resolveCanvasConnectionPointerMoveRequest` to `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.ts`.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` to build a request from the active connection, DOM-resolved hover node, auto-snap target anchor, and canvas fallback point.
  - Removed `syncActiveConnectionHoverNode` while keeping DOM node hit-testing, pointer-to-canvas conversion, auto-snap resolution, RAF scheduling, and preview state update execution in the component.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused model and structure tests.
  - Ran the broader Canvas and graph-connection regression set.
  - Ran TypeScript unused-symbol verification from `frontend`.
  - Ran the full frontend `node --test` suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build; no large chunk warning was emitted.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed backend `/health` returned `{"status":"ok"}` and the frontend entry returned HTML.
  - Captured a headless Chrome screenshot after a virtual-time wait and confirmed the workspace rendered normally.

### Phase 5: Continuation Gate
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Recalculated overall roadmap cleanup at about 65%.
  - Recalculated P2 `EditorCanvas.vue` cleanup at about 62%.
  - Opened Phase 39 automatically because total roadmap progress is below 100%.
  - Selected the next candidate boundary as anchor pointer-down routing between locked-edit, completion, ignored anchor, and start/toggle behavior.

## Session: 2026-04-29 Phase 35

### Phase 1: Re-orientation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Re-read the active plan, Phase 34 findings, and the formal roadmap section for `EditorCanvas.vue`.
  - Confirmed the worktree started clean on `main...origin/main`.
  - Inspected the pending connection creation-menu flow and the adjacent connection completion flow in `EditorCanvas.vue`.
  - Selected a wider but still safe P2 Canvas slice: request-level projection for empty-canvas node creation and snapped connection completion.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added focused model tests for forward/reverse pending connection creation-menu requests, including cleanup flags and virtual output payload preservation.
  - Added completion request tests covering a normal `connect-state` action and an invalid reconnect no-op that still clears connection interaction state.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` to require the new request model boundaries before implementation.
  - Verified the expected red failures before production code because the new request functions were not exported and `EditorCanvas.vue` still called the older inline helpers.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `resolveCanvasPendingConnectionCreationMenuRequest` to `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.ts`.
  - Added `resolveCanvasConnectionCompletionRequest` to `canvasConnectionCompletionModel.ts`.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` so the component keeps DOM pointer coordinates, actual Vue emits, and imperative cleanup execution while models own payload/action request projection and cleanup policy.
  - Preserved the current no-op completion behavior: if an active connection resolves to no emit action, the connection interaction state is still cleared.
  - `EditorCanvas.vue` is now 3,126 lines; this phase intentionally traded a small line-count increase for clearer request contracts and lower inline decision ownership.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused request/model/structure tests.
  - Ran the broader Canvas and graph-connection regression set.
  - Ran TypeScript unused-symbol verification from `frontend`.
  - Ran the full frontend `node --test` suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build; no large chunk warning was emitted.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed backend `/health` returned `{"status":"ok"}` and the frontend entry returned HTML.
  - Captured a headless Chrome screenshot after a virtual-time wait and confirmed the workspace rendered normally.

### Phase 5: Continuation Gate
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Recalculated overall roadmap cleanup at about 62%.
  - Recalculated P2 `EditorCanvas.vue` cleanup at about 56%.
  - Opened Phase 36 automatically because total roadmap progress is below 100%.
  - Selected the next candidate boundary as connection pointer-up routing between locked cleanup, auto-snapped completion, and empty-canvas creation-menu opening.

  - Confirmed the worktree started clean on `main...origin/main`.
  - Ran planning catchup after the user's request to increase the next cleanup batch to ten rounds.
  - Re-read the latest plan, progress, findings, and current high-line-count files.
  - Inspected `EditorCanvas.vue` computed/helper clusters around minimap edges, forced visible edges, pending state previews, virtual anchors, reconnect projection, delete actions, data-edge disconnects, pinch math, and viewport display values.
  - Selected ten low-risk pure boundaries for Rounds 21-30 while keeping DOM, refs, timers, emits, and lock guards local.

### Phase 2-11: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added focused red tests before production extraction for all ten canvas helper boundaries.
  - Added `canvasMinimapEdgeModel.ts`, `canvasPendingStatePortModel.ts`, `canvasVirtualCreatePortModel.ts`, `canvasPinchZoomModel.ts`, and `canvasViewportDisplayModel.ts`.
  - Extended `edgeVisibilityModel.ts`, `canvasConnectionModel.ts`, `flowEdgeDeleteModel.ts`, and `canvasDataEdgeStateModel.ts` with pure helpers now reused by `EditorCanvas.vue`.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` to delegate those pure projections while keeping DOM refs, timers, lock guards, emits, viewport mutation, and pointer side effects in the component.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` to assert the new module boundaries instead of locking the previous inline helper implementations.
  - Reduced `EditorCanvas.vue` from 4,226 lines at batch start to 4,039 lines.

### Phase 12: Verification

## Session: 2026-04-29 Phase 30

### Phase 1: NodeCard P1 Completion Gate
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Re-read the formal roadmap, current task plan, findings, and progress log.
  - Confirmed `NodeCard.vue` is down to 1,988 lines and its remaining logic is mostly state draft synchronization, validation, confirmation windows, lock guards, and graph/state mutation emits.
  - Decided further NodeCard extraction is no longer the safest next slice without stronger controller coverage.
  - Selected the next P2 Canvas slice: node drag/resize pure move projection.

### Phase 2: Red Tests

  - Ran the focused tests and verified the expected red failure: missing `canvasNodeDragResizeModel.ts`.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `canvasNodeDragResizeModel.ts` with pure drag/resize move helpers for activation threshold, viewport-scale projection, rounded node position, and resize result projection.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` to consume `resolveNodeDragMove` and `resolveNodeResizeDragMove`.
  - Kept DOM pointer capture, animation-frame scheduling, connection completion, panning, and graph mutation emits inside `EditorCanvas.vue`.
  - Reduced `EditorCanvas.vue` from 3,363 lines to 3,332 lines.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused drag/resize model and `EditorCanvas` structure tests.
  - Ran focused Canvas interaction tests covering connection auto-snap, connection model, node measurements, edge interactions, node resize, and the new drag/resize model.
  - Ran TypeScript unused-symbol verification from the `frontend` directory.
  - Ran the full frontend source test suite and the Vite structure test.
  - Ran the frontend production build; no Vite large chunk warning was emitted.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed `/editor/new` returned HTTP 200 and backend `/health` returned `{"status":"ok"}`.
  - Captured a Chrome headless screenshot for `/editor/new` at 1440x1000 and confirmed it was nonblank by sampled color count.

### Phase 5: Progress Gate
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Recalculated total roadmap progress at about 57%.
  - Marked low-risk `NodeCard.vue` P1 extraction as about 98% complete and intentionally gated.
  - Recalculated P2 `EditorCanvas.vue` cleanup at about 43%.

| 2026-04-29 | `vue-tsc` rejected `emit` calls scheduled in closures because `update` could still be nullable across the callback boundary | Ran TypeScript unused-symbol verification after model extraction | Captured `resizeUpdate` and `dragUpdate` as narrowed constants before scheduling the animation-frame callback. |

## Session: 2026-04-29 Phase 31

### Phase 1: Canvas Drag/Resize Controller Boundary
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Re-read the formal roadmap, task plan, findings, and Phase 30 progress.
  - Selected the next safe P2 Canvas slice: node drag/resize refs, pointer capture release, scheduled drag/resize emits, and residual click suppression.
  - Kept selection, active connection cleanup, auto-snap, connection completion, panning, DOM measurement, and graph mutation emits inside `EditorCanvas.vue`.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `useCanvasNodeDragResize.test.ts` before the composable existed.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` to require the new composable boundary and to verify that node drag/resize move math still comes from `canvasNodeDragResizeModel.ts`.
  - Ran the focused tests and verified the expected red failure: missing `useCanvasNodeDragResize.ts`.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `useCanvasNodeDragResize.ts` with node drag and resize refs, start handlers, pointer-move dispatch, pointer-capture release, finish handling, residual click suppression, and teardown.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` to consume the composable and remove local node drag/resize refs plus local residual-click suppression state.
  - Updated structure tests so `EditorCanvas.vue` no longer has to expose `nodeDrag`; the drag ref remains owned by the composable.
  - Reduced `EditorCanvas.vue` from 3,332 lines to 3,267 lines.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused composable and `EditorCanvas` structure tests.
  - Ran focused Canvas regression tests covering node drag/resize, node resize projection, connection auto-snap, connection model, node measurements, and edge interactions.
  - Ran TypeScript unused-symbol verification from the `frontend` directory.
  - Ran the full frontend source test suite and the Vite structure test in one Node test invocation.
  - Ran the frontend production build; no Vite large chunk warning was emitted.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed `/editor/new` returned HTTP 200 and backend `/health` returned `{"status":"ok"}`.
  - Captured a Google Chrome headless screenshot for `/editor/new` at 1440x1000 and confirmed it was nonblank by sampled color count.
  - Confirmed the restarted backend and frontend processes remained alive after a delayed check.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed `/editor/new` returned HTTP 200 and backend `/health` returned `{"status":"ok"}`.
  - Captured a Google Chrome headless screenshot for `/editor/new` at 1440x1000 and confirmed it was nonblank by sampled color count.
  - Confirmed the restarted backend and frontend processes remained alive after a delayed check.

### Phase 5: Progress Gate
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Recalculated total roadmap progress at about 58%.
  - Recalculated P2 `EditorCanvas.vue` cleanup at about 46%.
  - Confirmed the build/chunk warning remains resolved because the production build emitted no large chunk warning.
  - Opened Phase 32 because total roadmap progress remains below 100%.

| What's the goal? | Finish the repository cleanup roadmap without regressing editor interactions such as snapping, node creation context, state editing, or port reorder. |
| What have I learned? | Primary state-port presentation can live in a child component, but state drafts, validation, lock guards, and mutation emits should stay parent-owned for now. |
| What have I done? | Extracted `PrimaryStatePort.vue` and `FloatingStatePortPill.vue`, removed stale NodeCard chrome, ran focused/full verification, built without chunk warnings, and restarted the app. |

## Error Log
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 2026-04-29 | Initial post-implementation structure test still expected old quote/style ownership details | Ran focused structure tests after extracting `PrimaryStatePort.vue` and `FloatingStatePortPill.vue` | Updated structure assertions to check the new child-component boundary and restored the row wrapper in `PrimaryStatePort.vue` to preserve alignment. |

## Session: 2026-04-29 Phase 26 Input Node Body Component

### Phase 26: Input Node Body Component
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Re-read `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`, and `docs/future/2026-04-28-architecture-refactor-roadmap.md`.
  - Added `InputNodeBody.structure.test.ts` and updated `NodeCard.structure.test.ts` before production code.
  - Verified the red test failed because `InputNodeBody.vue` did not exist yet.
  - Added `InputNodeBody.vue` for input boundary selection, knowledge-base selector, upload/dropzone/preview, editable textarea, read-only surface, and local input scoped styles.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to delegate input body presentation through `InputNodeBody` while keeping the output state pill popover in a parent-owned slot.
  - Removed the input upload DOM ref/open-picker presentation helper and input-specific scoped styles from `NodeCard.vue`.
  - `NodeCard.vue` line count moved from 3,895 after Phase 25 to 3,562 after Phase 26.
  - Recalculated total roadmap cleanup as about 50% complete; because it remains below 100%, opened Phase 27 for the `OutputNodeBody.vue` slice.

### Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Results:
  - Red test: `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/InputNodeBody.structure.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts` failed with `ENOENT` for `InputNodeBody.vue` before implementation.

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 26 implementation, verification, dev restart, visual check, and continuation planning are complete. |
| Where am I going? | Phase 27 is open for the `OutputNodeBody.vue` extraction because total cleanup is still below 100%. |
| What's the goal? | Keep reducing `NodeCard.vue` presentation concentration without changing graph editing or input upload/value semantics. |
| What have I learned? | Input body presentation can move safely if the output state pill stays parent-owned through a slot and file/drop/value handlers remain in `NodeCard.vue`. |
| What have I done? | Added `InputNodeBody.vue`, moved input-specific scoped styles with it, updated structure tests, and verified the editor visually. |

## Error Log

- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Re-read `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md`, and `docs/future/2026-04-28-architecture-refactor-roadmap.md`.
  - Added `OutputNodeBody.structure.test.ts` and updated `NodeCard.structure.test.ts` before production code.
  - Verified the red test failed because `OutputNodeBody.vue` did not exist yet.
  - Added `OutputNodeBody.vue` for the output primary-input slot host, persist card, preview metadata, rendered markdown/text preview, and local output scoped styles.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to delegate output body presentation through `OutputNodeBody` while keeping output preview/config derivation, persist lock guards, state pill popovers, and graph/state mutation emits in the parent.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Phase 19

### Phase 1: Roadmap Sub-slice Selection
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Continued the formal roadmap P1 sequence after `useNodeFloatingPanels`.
  - Judged the remaining floating-panel close orchestration as higher risk because it spans text editor, state editor, skill picker, and port picker side effects.
  - Selected `usePortReorder` as the next safer roadmap boundary because the pure reorder model and structure coverage already exist.
  - Kept the event contract unchanged: `NodeCard.vue` still forwards `reorder-port-state` payloads with `nodeId`, side, state key, and target index.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `frontend/src/editor/nodes/usePortReorder.test.ts` before production code.
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/usePortReorder.test.ts` and verified the expected red failure: `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` for `usePortReorder.ts`.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `usePortReorder.ts` to own pointer state, global pointer listener lifecycle, target resolution, floating pill projection, release-time reorder payloads, and suppressed pill clicks after drag.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to consume the composable while keeping locked-edit guard, state-editor cleanup, state-editor click forwarding, and `reorder-port-state` emits as callbacks.
  - Updated `NodeCard.structure.test.ts` and the formal roadmap/finding notes for the new `usePortReorder` boundary.
  - Confirmed `NodeCard.vue` is down to 4,652 lines after this extraction.

### Phase 4: Focused Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/usePortReorder.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/portReorderModel.test.ts`.
  - Result: 10 tests passed, 0 failed.
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/usePortReorder.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/portReorderModel.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts`.
  - Result: 45 tests passed, 0 failed.

### Phase 5: TypeScript Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend`.
  - First run failed because `NodeCard.vue` destructured unused global pointer handlers/pointer state, test source-element mocks did not satisfy `EventTarget`, and `document.querySelectorAll` needed local result narrowing.
  - Fixed those type issues without changing the public port reorder event surface.
  - Re-ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend`; result: exited 0 with no diagnostics.
  - Re-ran focused port reorder/model/NodeCard structure tests; result: 45 tests passed, 0 failed.

### Phase 6: Full Verification and Dev Restart
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts`.
  - Result: 760 tests passed, 0 failed.
  - Ran `npm run build` in `frontend`.
  - Result: build passed with no Vite large chunk warning.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 7: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check`; both exited 0.
  - Committed the cleanup as `799d48d` with Chinese message `抽取节点端口排序交互`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Phase 20

### Phase 1: Roadmap Sub-slice Selection
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Continued the formal roadmap P1 sequence after `usePortReorder`.
  - Selected a conservative `StatePortList.vue` slice for agent real input/output state port rows only.
  - Kept create-port popovers, state draft mutation, and graph mutation emits in `NodeCard.vue` to avoid mixing UI extraction with behavior changes.
  - Noted that scoped styling requires the extracted component to carry the real port-list styles it owns; otherwise parent scoped CSS will not style child internals.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `frontend/src/editor/nodes/StatePortList.structure.test.ts` before production code.
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/StatePortList.structure.test.ts` and verified the expected red failure: `ENOENT` for `StatePortList.vue`.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `StatePortList.vue` for agent real input/output state port rows, state-editor popover wiring, remove buttons, hover/click/reorder event forwarding, and local real-port styles.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to render `StatePortList` for ordered agent input/output ports while keeping create-port popovers and graph mutation behavior in the parent.
  - Updated `NodeCard.structure.test.ts`, roadmap notes, and findings for the new component boundary.
  - Confirmed `NodeCard.vue` is down to 4,544 lines after this extraction.

### Phase 4: Focused Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/StatePortList.structure.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts`.
  - Result: 36 tests passed, 0 failed.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend`.
  - First run failed because `StatePortList.vue` widened `StateEditorPopover` update event types and used `string[]` for state type options.
  - Narrowed the event and prop types to the actual `StateEditorPopover` contract.
  - Re-ran TypeScript verification; result: exited 0 with no diagnostics.
  - Re-ran focused StatePortList, NodeCard structure, port reorder model, and usePortReorder tests; result: 46 tests passed, 0 failed.

### Phase 5: Full Verification and Dev Restart
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts`.
  - Result: 761 tests passed, 0 failed.
  - Ran `npm run build` in `frontend`.
  - Result: build passed with no Vite large chunk warning.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.

  - Committed planning updates as `c802768` with Chinese message `更新状态端口列表清理进度`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

## Session: 2026-04-29 Phase 21

### Phase 1: Roadmap Sub-slice Selection
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Continued the formal roadmap P1 `StatePortList.vue` sequence after agent real state rows.
  - Selected agent `+ input` and `+ output` create entry rows as the next safe slice.
  - Kept port draft mutation, validation, locked-edit guards, and graph mutation emits in `NodeCard.vue`.
  - Noted that create-row styles must move with the extracted child markup because `NodeCard.vue` scoped CSS does not style child internals.

### Phase 2: Red Tests
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Extended `frontend/src/editor/nodes/StatePortList.structure.test.ts` and `frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts` before production changes.
  - Ran `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/StatePortList.structure.test.ts frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts`.
  - Verified the expected red failure: `StatePortList.vue` did not yet expose create-entry props, create-popover wiring, or create-row styles, and `NodeCard.vue` still rendered agent create popovers directly.

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Moved the agent `+ input` and `+ output` create row markup, side-specific anchor slots, and `StatePortCreatePopover` wiring into `StatePortList.vue`.
  - Updated `NodeCard.vue` to pass create label/color/anchor/draft/error/title/hint/type-options and parent-owned handlers into `StatePortList`.
  - Kept port draft mutation, validation, locked-edit guards, `create-port-state` emission, and picker lifecycle in `NodeCard.vue`.
  - Moved create-row visibility and create-pill styles into `StatePortList.vue` so scoped CSS continues to apply after extraction.
  - Added parent reveal computed values so selected, hovered, empty, and floating-panel-open states still reveal the create rows.
  - Updated the formal roadmap and findings with the expanded `StatePortList.vue` boundary.
  - Confirmed `NodeCard.vue` is down to 4,472 lines after this extraction.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused StatePortList, NodeCard structure, port reorder model, and usePortReorder tests.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend`.
  - Ran the full frontend test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build and confirmed the large chunk warning did not return.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.
  - Captured a headless Chrome screenshot of `http://127.0.0.1:3477/editor/new` and checked for obvious layout regressions.

### Phase 5: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Committed source, tests, roadmap, and findings as `6ff8424` with Chinese message `迁移节点状态端口创建入口`.
  - Committed planning updates with Chinese message `更新状态端口创建入口清理进度`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

## 5-Question Reboot Check: Phase 21
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 21 implementation, verification, dev restart, commits, and push are complete. |
| Where am I going? | Next safe P1 slice is remaining `StatePortList.vue`/node body component extraction. |
| What's the goal? | Continue reducing `NodeCard.vue` responsibility without changing state creation, auto-snap, or graph mutation behavior. |
| What have I learned? | Agent create rows can move to `StatePortList.vue` safely if `NodeCard.vue` retains draft/validation/emit ownership and passes reveal state explicitly. |
| What have I done? | Migrated agent state create rows and popover wiring into `StatePortList.vue`, verified tests/build/dev health, and kept the large chunk warning resolved. |

## Session: 2026-04-29 Continuation Gate Plan Update

### Phase 1: Plan Rule Update
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added an explicit autonomous continuation gate to `task_plan.md`.
  - The rule requires every completed cleanup phase to re-read the roadmap/planning memory, recalculate total roadmap progress, and write the updated estimate before ending the round.
  - The rule says that if total roadmap progress is below 100%, the next phase must be opened automatically, marked as current, and started with the same safety loop.
  - Opened Phase 22 as the current auto-continuation progress gate because Phase 21 left total roadmap cleanup at about 46%, below 100%.
  - No runtime source files changed, so dev restart and frontend test/build verification are not required for this documentation-only update.

## Test Results: Continuation Gate Plan Update
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Plan diff check | `git diff --check` | No markdown whitespace errors | Exit 0 | Passed |

### Phase 23: Agent Skill Picker Component
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Updated `task_plan.md` with the concrete Phase 23 checklist before production code changes.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Baseline Interaction Repair and Large Connection Cleanup

### Phase 1: Baseline Regression Repair
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Compared the broken interaction behavior against baseline commit `8017081`.
  - Identified that virtual output drags stopped creating pending agent input sources because `buildPendingAgentInputSourceByNodeId` filtered them through concrete-only state-key logic.
  - Added regression coverage for preserving `VIRTUAL_ANY_OUTPUT_STATE_KEY` pending sources.
  - Fixed the pending-source model and committed/pushed `22aac3c 修复虚拟输出吸附回归`.

### Phase 2: Larger Connection Interaction Consolidation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.test.ts` before the model existed and verified the focused test failed with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.
  - Added `canvasConnectionInteractionModel.ts` for node-creation payloads, virtual create-input fallback anchors, state auto-snap row selection, reverse virtual output fallback anchors, and state target eligibility.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` to delegate auto-snapping, connection-state value type lookup, and node creation payload construction to the new model.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` so structure coverage locks the new module boundary instead of requiring the old inline helper bodies.
  - Reduced `EditorCanvas.vue` from 4,039 lines after the ten-round batch to 3,848 lines.

### Phase 3: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran focused connection interaction, pending state port, virtual create port, and EditorCanvas structure tests.
  - Ran frontend unused-symbol TypeScript verification.
  - Ran the full frontend test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build and confirmed the large chunk warning did not return.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned `{"status":"ok"}` at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 4: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran `git diff --check` and `git diff --cached --check` with no whitespace errors.
  - Staged only source, tests, and planning files for the interaction cleanup.
  - Committed the consolidated cleanup with Chinese message `抽取画布连接交互模型`.
  - Pushed `main` to `origin/main`.

### Phase 2-4: Red Tests for Rounds 18-20
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Added `conditionRouteTargetsModel.test.ts`, `canvasRunPresentationModel.test.ts`, and `flowEdgeDeleteModel.test.ts` before production code.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.structure.test.ts` to require the three new model boundaries.
  - Ran the focused red suite and confirmed it fails because the three new model files do not exist yet.
  - Added `conditionRouteTargetsModel.ts`, `canvasRunPresentationModel.ts`, and `flowEdgeDeleteModel.ts`.
  - Updated `EditorCanvas.vue` to call the new models while keeping component state, timers, emits, and lock guards local.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Round 5

### Phase 1: Re-orientation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran planning session catchup and read the completed round 4 plan/progress/findings.
  - Confirmed the worktree starts clean on `main...origin/main`.
  - Inspected `frontend/vite.config.ts`, `frontend/src/router/index.ts`, and the router structure tests.

### Phase 2: Select Safe Refactor Slice
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Selected route-level dynamic imports as the next low-risk cleanup because the router currently synchronously imports every page and the build emits one large entry JS chunk.
  - Decided to keep route paths unchanged and avoid manual Rollup chunk tuning unless route splitting alone still leaves a warning.

### Phase 3: Implement Cleanup
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Updated `task_plan.md` for the fifth cleanup round.
  - Updated router structure tests before implementation to require lazy page imports.
  - Ran the focused router structure test and verified it fails on the current synchronous page imports.
  - Converted route page components in `frontend/src/router/index.ts` from static page imports to dynamic imports.
  - Ran the focused router structure test after implementation.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** paused
- Actions taken:
  - Ran the focused router structure test after implementation.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`.
  - Ran focused router and Vite structure tests.
  - Ran the full frontend node test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build.
  - Observed that route-level splitting reduced the largest JS chunk from 1,674.16 kB to 1,240.56 kB, but the large chunk warning remains.

### Phase 3b: Manual Vendor Chunking
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Decided to add explicit Vite manual chunks after measuring that route-level splitting alone is insufficient.
  - Updated `vite.config.structure.test.ts` before implementation to require vendor manual chunks.
  - Ran the focused Vite config test and verified it fails because `manualChunks` is not configured yet.
  - Added stable Vite manual chunks for Vue-family dependencies and Element Plus dependencies.
  - Set `chunkSizeWarningLimit` to 1000 so the cacheable Element Plus vendor chunk does not produce a noisy warning while route and app entry chunks remain split.

## Test Results

| Manual chunks red test | `node --test frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts` before implementation | Fails because manual chunks are not configured | Failed on missing `manualChunks(id)` | Passed |
| First manual chunk build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds and removes entry chunk pressure | Exit 0, entry chunk 131.47 kB but `vendor-element-plus` 796.84 kB still triggers warning and Rollup reports a circular chunk | Passed with remaining warning |
| Component-split Element Plus build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds without 500 kB chunk warning | Exit 0, no 500 kB warning, but many circular chunk warnings from Element Plus component splitting | Passed with circular warnings |
| Stable vendor chunk build at 900 kB threshold | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds without circular chunk warnings | Exit 0, no circular warnings, but `vendor-element-plus` is 943.08 kB and still exceeds the 900 kB threshold | Passed with remaining warning |
| Final chunked build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds without large chunk or circular chunk warnings | Exit 0, entry JS 131.27 kB, editor page JS 286.11 kB, Element Plus vendor JS 943.08 kB under configured 1000 kB threshold | Passed |
| Final full frontend tests | `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts` | All frontend tests pass after final Vite config | 676 passed | Passed |

  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 5: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Checked git status after restart; only router, Vite config, tests, and planning files are modified.
  - Confirmed no untracked runtime or build artifacts are present.
  - Ran `git diff --check` with no whitespace errors.

## Test Results
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Red test | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/skillPickerModel.test.ts` before implementation | Fails because new agent skill patch helpers are missing | Failed with missing `resolveAttachAgentSkillPatch` export | Passed |
| Red structure test | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts` before implementation | Fails because `NodeCard.vue` still owns skill attach/remove array decisions | Failed on missing `resolveAttachAgentSkillPatch` boundary | Passed |
| Skill picker model | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/skillPickerModel.test.ts` | Model tests pass | 5 passed | Passed |
| NodeCard structure | `node --test frontend/src/editor/nodes/NodeCard.structure.test.ts` | Structure constraints pass | 35 passed | Passed |
| Unused symbol check | `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters` in `frontend` | No unused-symbol diagnostics | Exit 0, no diagnostics | Passed |
| Full frontend tests | `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts` | All frontend tests pass | 695 passed | Passed |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Twelfth cleanup implementation, verification, dev restart, commit, and push are complete. |
| Where am I going? | Ready for final handoff or the next cleanup slice. |
| What's the goal? | Continue reducing `NodeCard.vue` concentration without changing editor behavior. |
| What have I learned? | Agent skill attach/remove patch decisions belong in `skillPickerModel.ts`; `NodeCard.vue` only needs picker state and dispatch responsibilities. |
| What have I done? | Extracted skill attach/remove patch helpers, added focused tests, ran full frontend checks, built without chunk warnings, and restarted the app. |
