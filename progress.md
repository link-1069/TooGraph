### Phase 2: Select Safe Refactor Slice
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Selected flow hotspot, point anchor, projected edge, and connection preview style object helpers as the next pure canvas cleanup slice.

### Phase 3: Implement Cleanup
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Updated `task_plan.md` for the fourteenth cleanup round.
  - Added `canvasInteractionStyleModel.test.ts` before production code.

## Session: 2026-04-28 Round 5

### Phase 1: Re-orientation
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Ran planning session catchup and read the completed round 4 plan/progress/findings.
  - Confirmed the worktree starts clean on `main...origin/main`.
  - Inspected `frontend/vite.config.ts`, `frontend/src/router/index.ts`, and the router structure tests.

### Phase 2: Select Safe Refactor Slice
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Selected route-level dynamic imports as the next low-risk cleanup because the router currently synchronously imports every page and the build emits one large entry JS chunk.
  - Decided to keep route paths unchanged and avoid manual Rollup chunk tuning unless route splitting alone still leaves a warning.

### Phase 3: Implement Cleanup
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Updated `task_plan.md` for the fifth cleanup round.
  - Updated router structure tests before implementation to require lazy page imports.
  - Ran the focused router structure test and verified it fails on the current synchronous page imports.
  - Converted route page components in `frontend/src/router/index.ts` from static page imports to dynamic imports.
  - Ran the focused router structure test after implementation.

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** paused
- Actions taken:
  - Ran the focused router structure test after implementation.
  - Ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`.
  - Ran focused router and Vite structure tests.
  - Ran the full frontend node test suite.
  - Ran the frontend production build.
  - Observed that route-level splitting reduced the largest JS chunk from 1,674.16 kB to 1,240.56 kB, but the large chunk warning remains.

### Phase 3b: Manual Vendor Chunking
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Decided to add explicit Vite manual chunks after measuring that route-level splitting alone is insufficient.
  - Updated `vite.config.structure.test.ts` before implementation to require vendor manual chunks.
  - Ran the focused Vite config test and verified it fails because `manualChunks` is not configured yet.
  - Added stable Vite manual chunks for Vue-family dependencies and Element Plus dependencies.
  - Set `chunkSizeWarningLimit` to 1000 so the cacheable Element Plus vendor chunk does not produce a noisy warning while route and app entry chunks remain split.

## Test Results
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Red test | `node --test frontend/src/router/index.structure.test.ts` before router implementation | Fails because page components are still synchronously imported | Failed on static page imports and missing dynamic imports | Passed |
| Router structure | `node --test frontend/src/router/index.structure.test.ts` | Router structure tests pass | 3 passed | Passed |

| Full frontend tests | `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts` | All frontend tests pass | 675 passed | Passed |
| Route-split build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds and measures chunk output | Exit 0, largest JS chunk 1,240.56 kB with large chunk warning still present | Passed with remaining warning |
| Manual chunks red test | `node --test frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts` before implementation | Fails because manual chunks are not configured | Failed on missing `manualChunks(id)` | Passed |
| First manual chunk build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds and removes entry chunk pressure | Exit 0, entry chunk 131.47 kB but `vendor-element-plus` 796.84 kB still triggers warning and Rollup reports a circular chunk | Passed with remaining warning |
| Component-split Element Plus build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds without 500 kB chunk warning | Exit 0, no 500 kB warning, but many circular chunk warnings from Element Plus component splitting | Passed with circular warnings |
| Stable vendor chunk build at 900 kB threshold | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds without circular chunk warnings | Exit 0, no circular warnings, but `vendor-element-plus` is 943.08 kB and still exceeds the 900 kB threshold | Passed with remaining warning |
| Final chunked build | `npm run build` in `frontend` | Build succeeds without large chunk or circular chunk warnings | Exit 0, entry JS 131.27 kB, editor page JS 286.11 kB, Element Plus vendor JS 943.08 kB under configured 1000 kB threshold | Passed |
| Final full frontend tests | `node --test $(rg --files frontend/src -g '*.test.ts') frontend/vite.config.structure.test.ts` | All frontend tests pass after final Vite config | 676 passed | Passed |
| Dev restart | `npm run dev` | Services start and respond | Frontend 200, backend `/health` 200 | Passed |

### Phase 4: Verification
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Re-ran focused router and Vite structure tests after final chunk config.
  - Re-ran `npx vue-tsc --noEmit --noUnusedLocals --noUnusedParameters`.
  - Re-ran `npm run build`; the final build has no large chunk warning and no circular chunk warnings.
  - Re-ran the full frontend node test suite after the final Vite config.
  - Restarted the local dev environment with root `npm run dev`.
  - Confirmed the frontend returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:3477`.
  - Confirmed the backend health route returned HTTP 200 at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

### Phase 5: Commit and Push
- **Status:** completed
- Actions taken:
  - Checked git status after restart; only router, Vite config, tests, and planning files are modified.
  - Confirmed no untracked runtime or build artifacts are present.
  - Ran `git diff --check` with no whitespace errors.
  - Committed the cleanup as `91c629e` with Chinese message `优化前端构建拆包`.

## 5-Question Reboot Check
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Fifth cleanup implementation, verification, dev restart, commit, and push are complete. |

| What's the goal? | Continue reducing maintenance risk and address the production chunk warning without changing user behavior. |
| What have I learned? | Route-level dynamic imports dramatically reduce the app entry chunk; Element Plus is best kept as a stable cacheable vendor chunk instead of per-component manual chunks. |
| What have I done? | Added lazy route page loading, stable vendor chunks, a 1000 kB warning threshold, structure tests, and full verification. |
